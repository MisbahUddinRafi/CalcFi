<b>PROJECT NAME: </b> CalcFi

<p>
CalcFi is a simple calculator for basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations. This project was inspired from <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5kj-YsmWjM" target="_blank">Bro Code</a> YouTube channel. 
<br>
Actually I was looking for simple HTML, CSS and JS project to build. And I also had an enthusiast to build my own calculator project. So, basically this project is the starting of my web development journey. I started learning HTML, CSS and JS while building this project, and still learning everyday. 
<br>
I am planning to add more feature to this calculator in future. Gradually I will add more simple functionalities like calculating log, square, cube, powers, inverse, etc. And then I will slowly try to make this like the Casio FX-991 EX calculator, which is my favorite calculator.
